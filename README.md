# possibility-game

## Overview
This project integrates various concepts from probability and statistics into a Unity environment. Instead of using pre-built input and output methods, I developed my own dynamic system for handling user input and displaying results. Additionally, I added a gamification aspect to make learning and interaction more engaging.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project was to enhance my understanding of both Unity's internal workings and probability & statistics. By implementing custom methods for input and output, I gained deeper insights into Unityâ€™s event-driven architecture and improved my dynamic coding skills. At the same time, applying statistical concepts programmatically helped me grasp them more effectively.

## Features
- **Custom Input/Output Handling**: Built-in Unity input methods are replaced with custom implementations.
- **Gamified Experience**: The project includes interactive elements to make learning more enjoyable.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Users can input various statistical data dynamically and observe real-time calculations.
- **Educational Value**: Reinforces key probability and statistics concepts through interactive simulations.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity** (C# scripting)
- **Custom-built algorithms** for probability and statistics calculations
- **UI elements** to enhance user experience and interactivity

## Future Improvements
- Expand the range of statistical operations available
- Improve the UI for a more immersive experience
- Optimize the performance for handling larger datasets

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the scene and interact with the statistical models.

## License
This project is open-source and available for anyone interested in learning probability and statistics within Unity.
